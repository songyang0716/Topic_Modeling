### Topic Modeling
A repo that reproduced multiple topic modeling algorithms from scratch  

1. pLSA Probabilistic latent semantic analysis - **plsa.py**<br/>
The original paper could be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6705.pdf, use EM algorithm to estimate the topic distribution, words distribution in each document

2. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm - **lda.py**<br/>
The original paper could be found here http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf, the MCMC algorithm I used is the collapsed Gibbs Sampling https://people.cs.umass.edu/~wallach/courses/s11/cmpsci791ss/readings/griffiths02gibbs.pdf, which to me is simpler to implement than the variational inference proposed by the original author.
I test it on a small dataset, which includes around 120 Yelp reviews and covers three main categories (seafood, plumbing, pet shops) The algorithm could clearly identify the keywords for each topic.

3. Biterm Topic Model for Short Texts algorithm - **btm.py**<br/>
The original paper could be found in http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.402.4032&rep=rep1&type=pdf, 
the MCMC algorithm I used here is collpased Gibbs Sampling

4. Twitter Topic modeling <br/>
